Quick Start
===========

Welcome to Behat! Behat is a tool to close the `Behavior Driven Development`_
(BDD) communication loop. BDD is a methodology for developing software through
continuous example-based communication between developers and a business,
which this application supports. This communication happens in a form that
both the business and developers can clearly understand - examples. Examples are
structured around the ``Context-Action-Outcome`` pattern and are written in a
special format called *Gherkin*. The fact that Gherkin is very structural
makes it very easy to automate and autotest your behaviour examples against
a developing application. Automated examples are then actually used to drive
this application development TDD-style.
