Executing Behat
===============

I think we're ready to see Behat in action! Let's run it:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ vendor/bin/behat

You should see that Behat recognised that you have 3 scenarios. Behat should
also tell you that your ``FeatureContext`` class has missing steps and proposes
step snippets for you. ``FeatureContext`` is your test environment. It is an
object through which you will describe how you would test your application against
your features. It was generated by the ``--init`` command and now looks like this:

.. code-block:: php

    // features/bootstrap/FeatureContext.php

    use Behat\Behat\Context\SnippetAcceptingContext;
    use Behat\Gherkin\Node\PyStringNode;
    use Behat\Gherkin\Node\TableNode;

    class FeatureContext implements SnippetAcceptingContext
    {
        /**
         * Initializes context.
         */
        public function __construct()
        {
        }
    }
