Configuring Behat
=================

Custom Autoloading
------------------

Sometimes you will need to place your ``features`` folder somewhere other than the
default location (e.g. ``app/features``). All you need to do is specify the path
you want to autoload via ``behat.yml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # behat.yml

    default:
        autoload:
            '': %paths.base%/app/features/bootstrap
                
.. note::

    Using ``behat.yml`` to autoload will only allow for ``PSR-0``
    You can also use ``composer.json`` to autoload, which will also
    allow for ``PSR-4``
